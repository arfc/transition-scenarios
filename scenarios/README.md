# Scenarios

This folder contains various projects conducted in cyclus.

## 2014-E&S
Summary: Transition scenarios for evaluation groups from 
the 2014 E&S Study from the U.S. Department of Energy.


## 2017-bae-europe
Summary: French fleet simulation with random lifetime 
extension and sensitivity analysis.


## aqueous_reprocess
Summary: A simulation where uox_waste is output as 
reprocess_waste, uox_U and uox_Pu to get familiar 
with the separations cycamore archetype. It 
contains a source, separations and sink facility.


## eu_1950-2020
Summary: A project simulating the number of reactors 
and net capacity of a hypothetical system.


## EU_1950_to_2020_reprocess
Summary: A project building off of eu_1950_2020 to
simulate the number of reactors and net capacity of 
a hypothetical system with reprocessing capabilities.


## haleu
Summary: This directory contains the input files and 
analysis of multiple transition scenarios to advanced 
reactors fueled by High Assay Low Enriched Uranium 
(HALEU).


## predicting-the-past
Summary: This directory contains the input files and
analysis of multiple scenarios of european systems and
United States validations.


## standardized-verification
Summary: This input file simulates the paper Standards 
Verification of Fuel Cycle Modeling by Feng et al. (2016)
