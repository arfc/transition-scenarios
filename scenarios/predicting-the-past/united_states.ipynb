This can be explained from the difference in simulation and real-world refueling times. \n",

    "Due to software limitations of _CYCLUS_, refueling time for reactors can only be entered in integers of month, and stayed constant throughout the lifetime of the plant whereas actual refueling time varies in floating points of month and changes depending on various factors. The _CYCLUS_ simulation used to obtain the power generated over time assumes a refueling period of 1 month. According to the NEI, the average  refueling period for reactors in the United States varies quite significantly. The average refueling period in 1990 was 104 days, a period of over 3 months, and generally decreases to an average refueling period of 35 days, a period  just over 1 month, in 2017. As published by the NEI, the average refueling period of nuclear reactors in the United States is greater than 1 month between 1990 and 2017 [3]. This means that the power generated by the reactors deployed in the _CYCLUS_ simulation will have a greater amount of power generated over a period of time."
