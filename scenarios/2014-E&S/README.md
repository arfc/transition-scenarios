This file contains information related to transition scenarios for 
evaluation groups from the 2014 E&S Study from the U.S. Department of 
Energy. The information contained here applies to the directories
named ```eg01-egYY``` in which ```YY``` are the two numbers of the 
evaluation group transitioned to. 

This file contains specific details about the transition
scenarios such as fuel mass, composition, and refueling
cycles. The file also identifies some gaps in the current
CYCLUS regarding transition scenarios.

## Assumption, Parameters, Models and References:

1. The compositions, core mass and reactor ratio are obtained from [appendix B of E&S study](https://fuelcycleevaluation.inl.gov/Shared%20Documents/ES%20Appendix%20B.pdf).

2. The assumptions of net installed power increase and advanced technology availability are obtained from [FCO study](https://github.com/arfc/transition-scenarios/files/796778/5061-.final.pdf).

3. `CYCAMORE::REACTOR`, the recipe reactor, was used for the reactor archetype.

4. `CYCAMORE::MIXER`, the fixed ratio mixer, was used for the fuel fabrication archetype.

5. EG23 and EG24 are done using an approximate recipe from ORGIEN.

6. EG29 and EG30 are done using a simplification (4 group - U, TRU, MA, FP) model.

7. For SFRs, blanket and driver are averaged into one 'core' (added mass with weighted composition).

## Gaps:

1. Recipe Reactor Limitations:
   * Can't match with Burnup, needs recipe (always same composition out)

2. Fuel Cycle Facility limitations:
   * Simple infinite capacity / throughput
        instead of deployment of multiple facilities depending on need.
   * FuelFab cannot mix three commodities (Nat U, Rep U, Rep TRU/Pu)

3. FR modeling limitations:
   * blanket and driver composition has to be averaged
   * Separate EFPY for blanket and driver can't be modeled

4. Can't Match Demand:
   * Demand of FR fuel can't be met, and the FR just gets deployed, but does not produce power

5. EG29, 30 reprocessed material only goes in one mixer if both mixer has infinite throughput / buffer.

6. Throughput should be adjusted according to fuel demand, in order for the distribution
of fissile commodity (rep U, TRU, PU) among different fuel fab facilities.
( If two facilities with infinite throughput (demand of commodity A) exists, one facility gets all
the commodity A and the other none. Also, When given a situation where multiple demands cannot be met,
the agent with a higher demand quantity is preferred.)
