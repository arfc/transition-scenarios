Transition to HALEU reactors
----------------------------

This directory contains the input files and analysis of multiple 
transition scenarios to advanced reactors fuel by High Assay 
Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). 

Input files:
===========
The input files in the repository are the ``.xml`` input files for 
|Cyclus|. Each of these inputs read in other ``.xml`` files for the 
light water reactors (LWR) currently deployed in the US, the recipes 
for LWR fuel cycle, and the deployment times for the LWRs. These 
files and the |Cyclus| input files are generated by running 
``/transition-scenarios/scripts/create_input.py``.

Analysis:
=========
The analysis directory contains a jupyter notebook (``analysis/scenario_data_analysis.ipynb``)
to calculate and compare resource requirements of each fuel cycle 
scenario simulated. All of the figures created in the jupyter notebook
are saved in the ``figures/`` directory.
