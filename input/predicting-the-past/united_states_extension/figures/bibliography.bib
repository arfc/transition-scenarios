The goal of Cyclus is to enable a broad spectrum of fuel cycle simulation while providing a low barrier to entry for new users and agent developers. Cyclus engages with potential module developers and encourages them to join a vibrant community in anexpanding ecosystem. Users and developers are always welcome and encouraged to use or contribute to the Cyclus project.},

	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

Nationale d’Evaluation reports [1] emphasizes preparation
for a transition from Light Water Reactors (LWRs) to

to explore the feasibility of using Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF)
from other EU nations for French transition into a SFR fleet
without additional construction of LWRs. A Cyclus simulation
is run from 1950 to 2160 for EU to track the UNF mass
and to determine the necessary reprocessing and mixed oxide
(MOX) fabrication capacity to support the transition into
SFRs. The study concludes that France can avoid deployment
of additional LWRs by accepting UNF from other EU nations.},
