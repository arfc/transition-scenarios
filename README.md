## Script Folder
The script folder contains scripts that can be used to generate cyclus
input files and anaylse cyclus output files.




### write_reactors.py
Python script for Cyclus input file generation.

The assumptions for the parameters are as follows:

	Cycle 		= 18 months (timesteps) for all
	Refueling 	= 2 months (timesteps) for all
	assembly mass 	= 180 UO2 / assembly for BWRs
			  		  523.4 UO2 / assembly for rest [PWR](nucleartourist.com)
	#of assemblies 	= 193 for 1000MWe, linearly adjusted for other capacities

This script allows generation of cyclus input file types from csv files.

Input : csv file, initial_time, duration, reprocessing 


	    
    csv_file: the csv file containing country, reactor name and capacity
    
    initial_time: initial time of the simulation in yyyymmdd

    duration: duration of the simulation in months
    
    
Output : A complete input file ready for simulation. (default: complete_input.xml)
    
To run:

	python write_reactors.py [csv_file] [init_time] [duration]


### analysis.py
Script that can be used to:
1. print total snf amount and isotope mass (analysis.snf(cursor))
2. create stacked bar chart of power capacity and number of reactors per region (analysis.plot_power(cursor))
3. create a multi-line plot chart of waste isotope per time (analysis.isotope_vs_time(cursor))

The following command on the terminal will execute all three:

`python anaylsis.py [cylcus_output_file]`


## Templates Folder
This folder contains templates that are used in the write_reactors.py script.

### input_template.xml.in
Jinja Template for the entire Cyclus input file.

This is where the compiled reactor and region files will be rendered into.

fuel composition data is from:

mox_fuel_recipe / na_fr_fuel -> [Benchmark Study on Nuclear Fuel Cycle Transition Scenarios Analysis Codes](http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/44/089/44089401.pdf?r=1) 
(2012, IAEA)

uox_used_fuel -> [Spent Nuclear Fuel Assay Data for Isotopic Validation](https://www.oecd-nea.org/science/wpncs/ADSNF/SOAR_final.pdf) 
(2011, IAEA)

### reactor_template.xml.in
Jinja template for the reactor section of the cyclus input file.

### reactor_mox_template.xml.in
Jinja tempalte for reactors that use mox

### deployinst_template.xml.in
Jinja template for the individual region prototype of the cyclus input file.

### region_output_template.xml.in
Jinja template for the region section of the cylcus input file.

Grouped region prototypes will be rendered into this file.


## Database Folder

# eu_reactors_pris.csv
The eu_reactors_pris.csv file lists all the nulear reactors in europe,
but more in detail. The data is from [PRIS - IAEA](https://www.iaea.org/pris/)
and is converted to as csv file.

The csv file lists the following :
* Country
* Reactor Unit (name)
* Type
* Net Capacity (MWe)
* Status
* Operator
* Construction date
* Construction year
* First criticality date
* Two empty columns for start / end date (for deployinst)
* First grid date
* Commercial date
* Shutdown date
* UCF (Unit Capacity Factor) for 2013 (in %)
