        dictionary of the DeployInst defining the deployment of LWRs
    lwr_path: str
        path to directory containing xml files defining each LWR in
        the simulation
    duration: int
        number of time steps in the simulation
    reactor_prototypes: dict
        dictionary of information about prototypes in the form
        {name(str):(power(int),lifetime(int))}
    demand_eq: array
        energy demand at each time step in the simulation, length
